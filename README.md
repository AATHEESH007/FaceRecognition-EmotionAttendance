# 🎭 Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection System

A real-time **Facial Emotion Detection** system built using **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
The system detects faces from a webcam feed and predicts human emotions using a **CNN model trained on the FER-2013 dataset**.

This project is suitable for **Machine Learning mini projects**, **final year projects**, and **face attendance systems with emotion analysis**.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time webcam emotion detection
- Face detection using Haar Cascade
- Emotion recognition using a pretrained CNN (Mini-Xception)
- Supports 7 emotions:
  - Angry
  - Disgust
  - Fear
  - Happy
  - Sad
  - Surprise
  - Neutral
- Works on CPU (no GPU required)
- Lightweight and fast

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Mini-Xception CNN**
- Trained on **FER-2013 dataset**
- Input size: `64 × 64` grayscale face images
- Framework: **TensorFlow + Keras**

> ⚠️ Note: Real-time emotion recognition accuracy depends on lighting, face orientation, and expression intensity.
